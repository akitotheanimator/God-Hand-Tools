# God Hand Tools

I have lost acess to my old account so i made a new one.
I will update the tools from the old pack.

# Thanks to CarLoiD and Kerilk
Carloid helped me a lot to understand further on how the god hand file system works, me and him got our brains to work on how the files storage their data to bring im the pack.
And Kerilk, Shotouts to this mad lad who documented the whole MOT documentation for the public. Thank you a lot!
**in case you're wondering, here's the MOT documentation: https://github.com/Kerilk/bayonetta_tools/wiki/Motion-Formats-%28mot-files%29**

# DAT Extractor

Works like the classic one, but BETTER, it reads all the contents of the god hand packed data (.dat) and extract all of the contents in there. This one has a more robust code and supports both GPF(Generic packed files) and MPF(Mega package file).
Now you can just drag the folders that you want to be readen on and the program will automatically look through all the subdirectories of it and read each dat that contains in there.
Or, you can simply drag and drog all the dat files on the .exe and it will be processed automatically.

# MdtoSmd2.0

Like the old one, it converts god hand .md models to valve smd. It has new features, like saving the bones as a *.bones* file. 
**you will need this tool in order to use MOTool.**
It have a map model support but **it's very W.I.P. i don't recomend trying to use it on map models.**

# MOTool
MOTool is a brand new tool for the pack that converts god hand MOT to valve SMD. You will need a .bones file to convert the files correctly, which i have implemented on the brand new version of MdtoSmd.
**This wouldn't be possible without KERILK. https://github.com/Kerilk**

**However, In order to have the MOTool to convert the .MOT to .smd, you need to extract your .MD model using MDToSMD2.0. MDToSMD2.0 is disponibilized on my god hand toolpack.**
