# God Hand Tools

**deprecated/obsolete tools got moved for another repository. https://github.com/akitotheanimator/God-Hand-Tools-Old-stuff-**

**This whole pack is made in C# frameworks 4.8**

I have lost acess to my old account so i made a new one.
God Hand Tools's purpose is to bring people packs of tools to convert god hand files to more flexible and modern ones.

# Blen2MOT 3.0

Blen2mot, but with new functionalities.
basically, this version is completely dependent and doesn't need the C# version of the program to be set up.
and now, you can individually set the precision curves rather than having the precision property to be applied on ALL curves.
