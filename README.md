# God Hand Tools

I have lost acess to my old account so i made a new one.
I will update the tools from the old pack.

# Thanks to CarLoiD
He helped me a lot to understand further on how the god hand file system works, me and him got our brains to work on how the files storage their data to bring im the pack.


# DAT Extractor

Works like the classic one, but BETTER, it reads all the contents of the god hand packed data (.dat) and extract all of the contents in there. This one has a more robust code and supports both GPF(Generic packed files) and MPF(Mega package file).
Now you can just drag the folders that you want to be readen on and the program will automatically look through all the subdirectories of it and read each dat that contains in there.
Or, you can simply drag and drog all the dat files on the .exe and it will be processed automatically









.DAT
The god hand DAT is a file that packs game assets, such as models, for example. It is pretty common to be seen when visualized on a AFS viewer.
